     * @deprecated This functionality is now included in the core SDK; the implementation of this
     *             method is now effectively a nop.
     *
     * If the provided motors are using a legacy motor controller, createEasyMotorController swaps
     * that controller out and installs an alternate 'EasyLegacyMotorController' DCMotorController
     * implementation for the duration of the OpMode. If the motors are using a modern motor controller,
     * an analogous swap to an 'EasyModernMotorController' is made. If a matrix motor controller is in
     * use, this function has no effect. The APIs to easy legacy and modern motor controllers
     * are <em>identical</em>, which helps simplify programming.
     *
     * <p>EasyLegacyMotorController is implemented on top of an {@link I2cDeviceSynch} instance
     * which completely handles all the complexities of read vs write mode switching and the
     * like, allowing the logic inside the controller itself to be extraordinarily simple.
     * In particular, the manual mode switching and loop() counting necessary with the stock
     * controller implementation is not needed. Just call the motor getPosition() or setPower()
     * methods or what have you, and the necessary bookkeeping details will be taken care of.</p>
     *
     * <p>The improvements in EasyModernMotorController are less dramatic, but still significant.
     * Of particular note is that write operations, including motor mode and power changes, happen
     * immediately rather than being deferred to the end of a loop() cycle. This significantly
     * simplifies the steps that are necessary to create code that uses a modern motor controller
     * reliably.</p>
     *
     * <p>Easy motor controllers are not tied to SynchronousOpMode or any other particular
     * OpMode. They can be used, for example, from LinearOpModes. In SynchronousOpMode,
     * easy motor controllers are used automatically; in other OpModes, you'll have to manually
     * call {@link #createEasyMotorController} yourself.</p>
     *
     * This method takes as parameters one or both motors that reside on a given  motor
     * controller. If two motors are provided, they must share the same controller, and conversely
     * if two motors reside on a controller then both must be provided. The method creates a new
     * easy motor controller of the appropriate type and installs it as the controller for the provided
     * motors; the existing controller is disabled. When the current OpMode is complete, the processed
     * is reversed.
     *
     * @param opmodeContext the OpMode within which this creation is occurring
     * @param motor1    one of the up-to-two motor controllers which share a legacy motor controller. May be null.
